# Codaisseurify

First assignment for Codaiseur Academy was to create a new Rails app called Codaisseurify. This application is charge of managing a collection of songs and their associated artists.

##Steps

These are the steps I followed when working on this app:

1. Generate the App 
2. Creating two models: Song and Artist
3. Creating  inital data adding seeds to the database with some songs and artists
4. Adding index and show page
5. Adding create and delete button 
6. Testing models and associations 
7. Styling with Bootstrap 


## Running Locally
